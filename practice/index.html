            <p>
                My degree is in Computer Science. I love to be outdoors, going on hikes, hanging out with friends,
                 and filling the world with the light of Christ!
            </p>
            <p>I am not married.</p>
            <p> Some advantages I see from learning web design are learning how webpages work so
                 if there ends up being issues with them I can fix them and so that I can possible get a career
                 helping buisnesses set up their webpages.</p>
            <p> I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my entire life.</p>
