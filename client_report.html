        <h2>How did your decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
        <p>I was thinking over what I would like to have my site plan to be when I looked over at my games and decided to do a site on creating a game night with friends. <br>I then found some images online for the food items and some of the games. I also took some of the photos myself. <br>For the text, I did my best to describe the different items in a way that seems consistant between them all, and still descriptive.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>How did your communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</h2>
        <p>I communicated with my developer over teams messaging. We had very consistant messages back and forth about how the page is looking, what to do to fix some things, and just checking in. <br>There were no issues with communicating. Everytime that either of us messaged eachother, we responded in a fairly small amount of time, depending on how busy each of us were.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
        <p>The developer did meet the expectations that I had for the site. It is looking amazing!</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
        <p>What I would do differently is get to know my lead developer more before hiring them. That way I can make sure that they and their team are the right fit for completing my website.</p>
        <p><br></p>

        <h2>How did you manage your developement team and communicate the tasks to your junior devs?</h2>
        <p>I communicated with my development team over text messaging. Whenever I had updates for them, I sent it to them directly and kept them updated on the progress of the project. I then checked on their subpages consistantly to make sure that they were looking like the wireframe. Anytime there were any issues, I made sure to contact them directly and see what I could do to help them complete their portion of the project.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>How did your communicate with your client? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>I communicated with Mark Rowley over text and teams messaging, mostly teams messaging. I used text at first to check and see the progress of the site plan. After recieving the site plan, he asked for communication to be over teams and to use text only when it is something extremely important. So I did that. I stayed in contact with him through every part of the project, asking him to check the website often to make sure that it was looking like he was wanting it to.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
        <p>Publishing went very well. It uploaded to GitHub just fine and seemed to work very well. I sent the link to the client and when he looked at the link it seemed to work for him!</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
        <p>I felt that managing the site with GitHub worked very well. It was a great resource for being able to work together with other people and check on the overall progress of the project.</p>

        <h2>How did your communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>I stayed in contact with Ethan Anderson over text to make sure that I knew exactly what was going on at all times with the project and what I needed to do. There were no issues with contacting him.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for the site?</h2>
        <p>I did. As soon as the site plan was recieved, Ethan let me know what page I was to work on. We stayed in contact as I completed the HTML and CSS for the page. He made sure that it looked like the site plan says it should.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
        <p>I was able to contribute to the site by creating the "about us" page and setting it up with the looks of a timeline.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the site?</h2>
        <p>The only challenge that I ran into with adding my changes to the site was that GitHub had different sizes for the text and everything than live server did.</p>

        <h2>How did your communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>There were no issues with communicating with Taylor Asper. We just did not get the site plan for the site.</p>
