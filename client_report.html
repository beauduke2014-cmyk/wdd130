        <h2>How did your decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
        <p>I was thinking over what I would like to have my site plan to be when I looked over at my games and decided to do a site on creating a game night with friends. <br>I then found some images online for the food items and some of the games. I also took some of the photos myself. <br>For the text, I did my best to describe the different items in a way that seems consistant between them all, and still descriptive.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>How did your communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</h2>
        <p>I communicated with my developer over teams messaging. We had very consistant messages back and forth about how the page is looking, what to do to fix some things, and just checking in. <br>There were no issues with communicating. Everytime that either of us messaged eachother, we responded in a fairly small amount of time, depending on how busy each of us were.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
        <p>The developer did meet the expectations that I had for the site. It is looking amazing!</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
        <p>What I would do differently is get to know my lead developer more before hiring them. That way I can make sure that they and their team are the right fit for completing my website.</p>
